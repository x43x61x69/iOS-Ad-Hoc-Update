# iOS Ad-Hoc Update

**iOS Ad-Hoc Update** is a simple class for developers to build an auto updating feature for their non-App-Store-released iOS app, including ad-hoc and in-house distributions.

## Features

- Check against local version and a remote, Xcode-generated ad-hoc installation manifest file.
- Forced update option with minimum version settings.
- Promote update dialog and force quit the app before install new `.ipa` file over-the-air.
- Fully localizable UI.

## Usage

As simple as `[UIAdHocUpdate checkForUpdate:manifestURL]`. You can also use compile flag `IS_APP_STORE` to omit the checking in your App Store scheme.

Please see the example project.

## Note

The self-exit feature utilizes the `kill()` syscall, which will be considered as a crash. Thus, it will not quit properly when you use it while debugging on a physical iOS device with Xcode, as it will assert at that point. It works within the Simulator, however.
